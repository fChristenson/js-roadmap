# Editors

## General

There are plenty of editors to choose from and they will be your primary tools for writing code so finding one that you like is an important step.

It is a silly thing but most professionals use the same editors and if you don't want to stand out it is a good idea to pick one that is popular among the professionals, it is not a big deal if you pick something else but it will be something that will be noticed, how it comes off depends on the person making the observation.
